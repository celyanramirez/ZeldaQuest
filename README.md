## How to Run

### Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- Pygame 2.6.1+

### Running Locally
Since Pygame requires a display window, this game needs to be run on your local machine:

```bash
# Install pygame if not already installed
pip install pygame

# Run the game
python main.py
```

### Running in Replit (Desktop App)
If you're using the Replit desktop application with display support, you can run:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Controls

| Key | Action |

## Game Files

- **main.py** - Main game loop and scene management
- **player.py** - Player character with movement and combat
- **enemy.py** - Enemy AI and behavior
- **settings.py** - Game configuration and constants

## Gameplay Tips

1. **Combat Strategy**: Enemies have detection ranges - you can approach carefully
2. **Positioning**: Use walls to funnel enemies and avoid being surrounded
3. **Attack Timing**: Watch for the attack cooldown to maximize damage
4. **Enemy Types**: Focus on defeating goblins first (they're faster but weaker)
5. **Health Management**: Each enemy deals damage on contact - keep your distance!

## Customization

You can modify game parameters in `settings.py`:
- Player speed and health
- Enemy stats and behavior
- Screen size and tile dimensions
- Attack damage and cooldown times
